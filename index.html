  <div>An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides
    common services for computer programs.<br>
    Time-sharing operating systems schedule tasks for efficient use of the system and may also include accounting
    software for cost allocation of processor time,<br> mass storage, printing, and other resources.<br>
    For hardware functions such as input and output and memory allocation, the operating system acts as an intermediary
    between programs and the computer hardware,<br>
    although the application code is usually executed directly by the hardware and frequently makes system calls to an
    OS function or is interrupted by it.<br>
    Operating systems are found on many devices that contain a computer â€“ from cellular phones and video game consoles
    to web servers and supercomputers.<br>
    The dominant desktop operating system is Microsoft Windows with a market share of around 82.74%. macOS by Apple Inc.
    is in second place (13.23%),<br> and the varieties of Linux are collectively in third place (1.57%).<br>
    In the mobile sector (including smartphones and tablets), Android's share is up to 70% in the year 2017.<br>
    According to third quarter 2016 data, Android's share on smartphones is dominant with 87.5 percent with also a
    growth rate of 10.3 percent per year,<br> followed by Apple's iOS with 12.1 percent with per year decrease in market
    share of 5.2 percent, while other operating systems amount to just 0.3 percent.<br>
    Linux distributions are dominant in the server and supercomputing sectors.<br> Other specialized classes of
    operating systems, such as embedded and real-time systems, exist for many applications. <br>
