    Microsoft Windows, commonly referred to as Windows, is a group of several proprietary graphical operating system
    families,<br> all of which are developed and marketed by Microsoft. Each family caters to a certain sector of the
    computing industry.<br> Active Microsoft Windows families include Windows NT and Windows IoT; these may encompass
    subfamilies,<br> e.g. Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact (Windows CE). Defunct Microsoft Windows families
    include Windows 9x,<br> Windows Mobile and Windows Phone.

    Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20, 1985,<br> as a graphical operating
    system
    shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces (GUIs).<br> Microsoft Windows came
    to
    dominate the world's personal computer (PC) market with over 90% market share,<br> overtaking Mac OS, which had been
    introduced in 1984.<br> Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI
    development<br>
    as
    implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh (eventually settled in court in Microsoft's favor in
    1993).<br>
    On PCs, Windows is still the most popular operating system.<br> However, in 2014, Microsoft admitted losing the
    majority
    of the overall operating system market to Android,<br>because of the massive growth in sales of Android
    smartphones.<br>
    In 2014, the number of Windows devices sold was less than 25% that of Android devices sold.<br> This comparison,
    however, may not be fully relevant, as the two operating systems traditionally target different platforms.<br>
    Still,
    numbers for server use of Windows (that are comparable to competitors)<br> show one third market share, similar to
    that
    for end user use.

    Microsoft has made several advancements and changes that have made it a much easier to use Operating System, and<br>
    although arguably it may not be the easiest Operating System, it is still Easier than Linux.
    <br>Because of the large amount of Microsoft Windows users, there is a much larger selection of available software
    programs, utilities, and games for Windows.
    <br>>Microsoft Windows includes its own help section, has vast amount of available online documentation and help, as
    well as books on each of the versions of Windows.

    The type and nature of the data. This helps people who analyze it to effectively use the resulting insight.<br> Big
    data
    draws from text, images, audio, video; plus it completes missing pieces through data fusion.<br>
    <li>Disadventages</li>
    Microsoft Windows can run between $50.00 - $150.00 US dollars per each license copy.
    <br>Although Microsoft Windows has made great improvements in reliability over the last few versions of Windows, it
    still cannot match the reliability of Linux.
    <br>Although Windows does have software programs, utilities, and games for free, the majority of the programs will
    cost anywhere between $20.00 - $200.00+ US dollars per copy.
    <br>Although Microsoft has made great improvements over the years with security on their Operating System,<br>
    their Operating System continues to be the most vulnerable to viruses and other attacks.<br>
