    The Linux kernel originated in 1991, as a project of Linus Torvalds, while a university student in Finland.<br>
    He posted information about his project on a newsgroup for computer students and programmers, and received support
    and<br>
    assistance from volunteers who succeeded in creating a complete and functional kernel.<br>

    Linux is Unix-like, but was developed without any Unix code, unlike BSD and its variants. Because of its open
    license<br>
    model, the Linux kernel code is available for study and modification, which resulted in its use on a wide range
    of<br>
    computing machinery from supercomputers to smart-watches.<br> Although estimates suggest that Linux is used on only
    1.82% of all "desktop" (or laptop) PCs,<br>it has been widely adopted for use in servers and embedded systems such
    as
    cell phones.<br> Linux has superseded Unix on many platforms and is used on most supercomputers including the top
    385.<br> Many
    of
    the same computers are also on Green500 (but in different order), and Linux runs on the top 10.<br> Linux is also
    commonly
    used on other small energy-efficient computers, such as smartphones and smartwatches. <br>The Linux kernel is used
    in
    some popular distributions,<br> such as Red Hat, Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint and Google's Android, Chrome OS, and
    Chromium
    OS.<br>
