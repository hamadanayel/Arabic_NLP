  <div>Unix was originally written in assembly language. Ken Thompson wrote B, mainly based on BCPL<br>, based on his
    experience
    in the MULTICS project. B was replaced by C, and Unix, rewritten in C, developed into a large,<br> complex family of
    inter-related operating systems which have been influential in every modern operating system .<br>

    The Unix-like family is a diverse group of operating systems, with several major sub-categories including System V,
    BSD, and Linux. <br>The name "UNIX" is a trademark of The Open Group which licenses it for use with any
    operating<br>
    system that has been shown to conform to their definitions. <br>"UNIX-like" is commonly used to refer to the large
    set<br>
    of operating systems which resemble the original UNIX.<br>

    Unix-like systems run on a wide variety of computer architectures.<br> They are used heavily for servers in
    business,<br>
    as well as workstations in academic and engineering environments.<br> Free UNIX variants, such as Linux and BSD, are
    popular in these areas.
