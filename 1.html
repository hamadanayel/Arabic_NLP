  <div>Android is a mobile operating system based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open source
    software,<br>
    designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Android is developed by a<br>
    consortium of developers known as the Open Handset Alliance, with the main contributor and commercial marketer being
    Google.<br>

    Initially developed by Android Inc., which Google bought in 2005, Android was unveiled in 2007, with the first<br>
    commercial Android device launched in September 2008. The current stable version is Android 10, released on<br>
    September 3, 2019. The core Android source code is known as Android Open Source Project (AOSP), which is
    primarily<br>
    licensed under the Apache License. This has allowed variants of Android to be developed on a range of other<br>
    electronics, such as game consoles, digital cameras, PCs and others, each with a specialized user interface.
    <br>Some
    well known derivatives include Android TV for televisions and Wear OS for wearables, both developed by Google. <br>
